# Project Proposal

For my final project I would like to examine the relationship between unmet need for contraceptives and how that is related to experiences of preferences, access, religion, health empowerment, and intimate partner violence. For this section of the project I will utilize cross sectional data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Haiti. I have chosen to examine Haiti because it has the greatest reported rate of unmet need for contraceptives in the Americas and because it receives a large amount of health funding from the international community. For this part of the analysis I will rely on Stata. 

As part of this project, I would also like to address the policy implications of current health funding and evaluate if it is fact targeting the most important variables in determining unmet need (i.e.: if living in a rural area is strongly related to unmet need for contraceptives, are sexual health education programs targeting rural areas). I hope to utilize Python to compile data on funding organization and program type. 

To construct the theoretical framework for my research I will rely on other research that has focused on unmet need in developing countries and in Haiti. I will also use codebooks, surveys, and reports from the DHS to inform and contextualize my results. 

## Components of my project that I would like to include are:
* A data management plan that describes which data I used, how I accessed it, and how it can be accessed to be reused 
* A code book for the data and information about the surveys 
* Record of the codes I used to examine the data for recreation and verification 
* Bibliography of sources consulted
* This project proposal
* A final essay that reports theory, findings, and policy implications
